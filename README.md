### Malawi health facilities  
Analysing two sources for health facility locations in Malawi, their Master Facility List and data collected by WHO-KWTRP (Maina et al., 2019). This is as part of my MRes in Global Health and is supervised by Dr Andy South (https://github.com/afrimapr/afrihealthsites).  

My aim is to investigate differences between these sources, produce a summary that is useful and reproducible and mark areas for improvement.
